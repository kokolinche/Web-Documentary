                        <h3>HOW IT ALL BEGUN</h3>

                        <p>
                            Long time ago, in a small village of Denmark, a boy was born. On the day he was born, the stars aligned in a special way and gifted him with the best present that he was able to use all his life - his talent.
                            <br /><br />
                            Since a young boy, music was a big part of Asbjørn’s life. He grew up listening to famous musicians such as David Lynch and Leland Sklar, but his main inspiration was his own father, who is also a musician. Asbjørn learned from him what love for music is and picked up special skills which are required in order to become a great musician.

                        <h3>SMALL STEPS LEAD TO GREAT SUCCESS</h3>
                        <p>His journey through the world of music was a long and diverse one. From a young age he learned to play different instruments and never had only one favourite. His desire to gain as many skills as possible helped him know how to handle a variety of instruments.
                            <br /><br />
                            His main break through in his career as a young musician started during his studies at Aarhus Conservatory. Even then he didn’t stop playing only one instrument. He played double bass, synthesizer, drums, flute and he even started his career as a DJ by playing at different parties, however by the time he reached his master degree, he chose the keyboards as his main instrument.

                <h3>TRAVELS, TRAVELS...</h3>
                <p>Being a young musician means being involved in a variety of projects, along with other young musicians. In this way, Asbjørn had a big list of projects, which ment playing in different groups and performing very often at concerts around Aarhus, but Danmark wasn’t the only country lucky to have him perform here.
                    <br /><br />
                    Asbjørn was always interested in the culture of different countries, especially when it comes to music. He decided to go over places in order to learn about their music history. </p>
